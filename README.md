# step_count_app

This is step count android app which build using kotlin langauge.

it uses MVVM pattern, for later scalable problem solution.

It uses google fit api to access your step count for the past 24 hours.

This app is currently in debug mode, hence it is not published yet, due to which I will have to add testing email manually if you want to test this.

Steps to run:

in the root directory there is step_count.apk.

1- Install it on your device.

2- this app requires minimum of android oreo

3- Then share your email with me, so that I can add to testing email account.

Design choices:

1- I used MVVM pattern for better scalabilty and managebility. 

2- Problem were not that hard to handle, since the android documentation is easy to follow also google fit api is also great.
